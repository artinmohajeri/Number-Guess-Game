# NumberGuessGame
in this game you have to guess a number.
in this game at first you have to choose the difficulity of the game.
if you chose easy the range of numbers are (0,10)    normal=(0,100)    hard=(0,1000)
and if you chose easy the numbers of your guesses will be 4   normal=7   hard=10
you will guess a number and the programm will tell you that the real number is bigger that your guess or smaller so you will know what to guess after that.
HAPPY PLAYING 😀❤
